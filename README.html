<h1 lang='en-CA'>wayic.recast - Making new waycasts and casters</h1>
<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        This project develops a means of making new waycasts by replicating the way declarations
        of old ones.  From a personal point of view, its principal uses are (for the new waycaster)
        to start a waycast of one’s own, and (for the old waycaster) to gain potential collaborators.
        From a system point of view, it serves to extend the wayic in society.
