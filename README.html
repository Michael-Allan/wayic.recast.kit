<h1 lang='en-CA'>An installable recast kit for waycast self-replication</h1>
<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        Here is project wayic.recast.kit.  This project implements a systematic method of waycast
        self-replication based on a recast kit.  Installed in a waycast, the kit may be downloaded
        by viewers in order to create new waycasts of their own, each complete with a recast kit.
