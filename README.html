<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        Here is project wayic.recast.kit.  This project implements a method of way formation based on
        a recast kit.  Downloadable from an original waycast where it is installed, a recast kit enables
        anyone to make a new waycast that (by default) takes the form of the original.  Recast kits are
        a basic component of the wayic architecture, where they function as social extenders of the wayic
        in service to its purpose as a self-instituting system of aimed way formation.
