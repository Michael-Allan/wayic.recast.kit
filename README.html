<h1 lang='en-CA'>A recast kit for waycast replication</h1>
<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        This project implements a recast kit for waycasts, an instrument of way formation based
        on replicate way modelling.  Downloadable from an original waycast where it is installed,
        the recast kit enables anyone to make a new waycast that (by default) replicates the form
        of the original.  The recast kit is a basic component of the wayic architecture,
        where it functions as a social extender of the wayic in service to its purpose
        as a self-instituting system of way formation.
