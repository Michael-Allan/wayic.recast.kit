<h1 lang='en-CA'>wayic.recast - Making new waycasts and casters by replicate way modelling</h1>
<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        This project develops a method of making new waycasts by replicating the way declarations
        of old ones.  From a user point of view, its principal uses are (for the new waycaster)
        to start a waycast of one’s own, and (for the old waycaster) to gain potential collaborators.
        From a system point of view, it serves to ease the extension of the wayic in society
        and so further its purpose as a self-instituting system.
